# Implementation Plan: SendGrid Deliverability & Engagement Analytics Dashboard

**Branch**: `001-sendgrid-deliverability-engagement` | **Date**: 2025-10-03 | **Spec**: `specs/001-sendgrid-deliverability-engagement/spec.md`
**Input**: Feature specification from `specs/001-sendgrid-deliverability-engagement/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from file system structure or context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code, or `AGENTS.md` for all other agents).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary

**Primary Requirement**: Build a simple web dashboard that visualizes SendGrid email deliverability and engagement analytics from an Excel file, matching the SendGrid screenshot designs.

**Technical Approach (MVP - Simplified)**: Single Next.js application. User uploads Excel file → Parse in browser with ExcelJS → Store in React state → Render dashboard components (tables, charts, KPIs) → Export to CSV. No backend server, no database, no API layer.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.x / React 18+ / Next.js 14+  
**Primary Dependencies**: Next.js 14 (App Router), React 18, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, Recharts, ExcelJS, Luxon (timezone)  
**Storage**: React useState (in-memory, no persistence)  
**Testing**: Playwright (E2E only for MVP)  
**Target Platform**: Web (Vercel deployment), responsive desktop/tablet/mobile  
**Project Type**: **Single Next.js app** (no backend/frontend split)  
**Performance Goals**: Dashboard load <2s, filter <500ms, chart render <1s  
**Constraints**: Brisbane (AEST, UTC+10) timezone, WCAG 2.1 AA compliance  
**Scale/Scope**: 10,000 email events in browser memory, 7 dashboard components matching SendGrid screenshots

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**I. Data Integrity & Security**
- [x] All email event data transformations are auditable and reversible (FR-003, NFR-003: timestamp parsing logged, deduplication by sg_event_id)
- [x] Personal data (email addresses) handled with privacy-by-default (NFR-001: email masking unless authorized)
- [x] No PII exposed in logs, errors, or UI without authorization (NFR-001, NFR-005: masking + env vars for secrets)
- [x] Data deletion/modification includes authorization and logging (NFR-003: transformations auditable; FR-004A: append-only with dedup)

**II. UI/UX Consistency & Accessibility**
- [x] UI design aligns with SendGrid dashboard patterns (6 reference screenshots provided in spec)
- [x] WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance verified for all interactive components (NFR-006, NFR-007, NFR-008)
- [x] Responsive design tested on desktop and mobile breakpoints (NFR-009: ≥1024px, ≥768px, ≥375px)
- [x] Export and input controls are keyboard-navigable (NFR-007: full keyboard navigation required)

**III. Specification-Driven Engineering**
- [x] Feature documented in formal specification before implementation (spec.md completed and approved)
- [x] Specification includes testable acceptance criteria (6 acceptance scenarios, 7 edge cases defined)
- [x] All requirements trace back to approved spec document (35 functional, 21 non-functional requirements)

**IV. Modularity & Extensibility**
- [x] Clear separation of concerns: data ingestion, API, UI, analytics (web structure: backend/src vs frontend/src)
- [x] New event types or data sources can be added without major refactoring (NFR-019: designed for extensibility)
- [x] Dependencies pinned in package manifest (NFR-021: all deps pinned, automated build)
- [x] CI/CD pipeline configured for GitHub + Vercel (NFR-021, constitution mandates GitHub + Vercel integration)

**V. Robust Testing & Quality**
- [x] All significant functionality covered by automated tests (unit/functional/E2E) (NFR-015, NFR-017)
- [x] Metrics calculations verified against SendGrid canonical definitions (NFR-016, FR-015: formulas documented)
- [x] Test coverage ≥75% for critical data processing paths (NFR-015)
- [x] Code review checklist includes constitutional compliance (constitution governs all PRs)

**VI. Performance & Reliability**
- [x] Dashboard loads in <2s for 10,000 email dataset (NFR-010: <2s for 5k emails, NFR-014 pagination beyond 10k)
- [x] Search/filter responses <500ms (NFR-011)
- [x] Graceful failure handling for ingestion, sync, rendering errors (edge cases documented, FR-033-035: loading states)
- [x] Performance degradation alerts configured (NFR-018: no observability beyond platform logs for MVP - acceptable tradeoff)

**VII. Documentation & Collaboration**
- [x] API contracts, event logic, business rules documented in Markdown (Phase 1 will generate contracts/, data-model.md)
- [x] Inline comments for non-obvious logic, docstrings for public interfaces (constitution mandates, will enforce in tasks)
- [x] Onboarding documentation updated for new features/dependencies (quickstart.md in Phase 1)

```

**Structure Decision**: **Single Next.js application** – Excel parsing happens client-side; state lives in React context. The MVP remains lightweight and deployable via a single Vercel project.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. Confirm MVP tech stack (Next.js, Tailwind, shadcn/ui, Recharts, ExcelJS, Luxon)
2. Validate Excel column mappings (`SendGrid Stats.xlsx` → `EmailEvent` interface)
3. Document decisions/alternatives in `research.md`

**Output**: `research.md` (complete)

## Phase 1: Design Artifacts
*Prerequisite: Phase 0 complete*

1. Define TypeScript interfaces & derived metrics in `data-model.md`
2. Document quickstart scenarios & edge cases in `quickstart.md`
3. Update `WINDSURF.md` with simplified architecture notes

**Output**: `data-model.md`, `quickstart.md`, `WINDSURF.md`

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy (MVP)**:
- Use `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md`
- Derive tasks from:
  - `research.md` (framework setup decisions)
  - `data-model.md` (types & aggregations)
  - `quickstart.md` (6 scenarios + edge cases)
- Focus areas:
  - Project setup (Next.js, Tailwind, shadcn/ui)
  - Excel parsing & in-memory computations
  - Dashboard UI components (tables, charts, funnel, export)
  - Playwright E2E tests (scenarios from quickstart)
  - Deployment (Vercel)

**Ordering Strategy**:
- Phase 3.1: Setup (project scaffold, styling, dependencies)
- Phase 3.2: Core utilities (Excel parser, aggregations, state)
- Phase 3.3: UI components (upload, cards, tables, charts, funnel, categories, export)
- Phase 3.4: Polish (responsive layout, accessibility, performance checks)
- Phase 3.5: Testing & deployment (Playwright E2E, Vercel deploy, README)

**Parallelization**:
- Mark [P] for independent component tasks (distinct files)
- Utilities (parser, aggregations, filters) can run in parallel
- Playwright scenarios can be scripted in parallel after UI stabilizes

**Estimated Output**: ~20 tasks focusing on MVP delivery

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |


## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan) – `research.md` updated with simplified decisions
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan) – `data-model.md`, `quickstart.md`, `WINDSURF.md`
- [x] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan) – MVP task strategy documented
- [x] Phase 3: Tasks generated (/tasks) – `tasks.md` (to be regenerated for MVP scope)
- [ ] Phase 4: Implementation complete – **READY FOR EXECUTION**
- [ ] Phase 5: Validation passed

**Gate Status**:
- [x] Initial Constitution Check: PASS (all 7 principles validated against spec)
- [x] Post-Design Constitution Check: PASS (no violations introduced in design phase)
- [x] All NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved (via /clarify: 5 questions answered)
- [x] Complexity deviations documented (None - design aligns with constitution)

- ✅ `research.md` – MVP technology decisions (Next.js, Tailwind, Recharts, ExcelJS, Luxon)
- ✅ `data-model.md` – TypeScript interfaces & derived metrics (in-memory)
- ✅ `quickstart.md` – 6 acceptance scenarios + edge cases + performance validation
- ✅ `WINDSURF.md` – Agent context reflecting simplified architecture
- ✅ `tasks.md` – Implementation tasks (to be regenerated for simplified MVP)
